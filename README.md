Documento de diseño - Aplicación XR
Nombre de la aplicación y plataforma
Job Simulator for Playstation VR
Elevator Pitch
A wacky simulation of the menial jobs of today - like short-order cook and convenience store
clerk - as “created” by the artificial intelligence of the future. Makes heavy use of physics and
motion controllers to challenge players to complete silly physical tasks.

Público Objetivo
A broad audience of casual gamers and VR early adopters looking for a VR game that’s highly
immersive, but light and fun. It is very successful, avoiding some of the seriousness of other VR
experiments and embracing a cartoony aesthetic that works well within the limitations of VR.
XR Implementation
6DOF room-scale VR with motion control.

The game confines the player to the boundaries of the room-scale environment in a way that
makes perfect sense with the game story/theme. No player movement outside of the boundary
is necessary, which helps prevent motion sickness. But within that boundary, and using the
motion controllers, the player has absolute freedom to interact with a rich environment full of
props, and complete tasks with them that are silly and fun.
Tecnologías de apoyo
Haptic feedback from the motion controllers helps add tactility to all of the objects that you
interact within the game.

Fortalezas de la aplicación
Highly interactive environment with freedom to experiment with all manner of props
Simple cartoon style that is bright and engaging, and helps keep frame rates high
Unique sense of humor that stands out among VR shooter and roller coaster apps.
Áreas para mejorar
VR calibration can be easy to mess up, and getting back to the configuration screen takes many
steps. Add an affordance to re-run the calibration from anywhere in the game.
